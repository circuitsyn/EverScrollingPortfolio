                    As some may know I recently moved out to Seattle. It was a big move as a born and raised Brooklyn, NY native. I recently started looking for community and ways to get to know this great town. Seattle has an amazing mix of history, nature, technology and a myriad of firsts, plus bests. I recently had the pleasure to come across an amazing organization called <a target="_blank" href="https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/">TCAT – The Taskar Center for Accessible Technology</a>. They are an organization that is housed in the  Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science at The University of Washington. TCAT is utilizing and making open source technologies to help others with disabilities live a full and equal life.  They throw frequent events so always make sure to check their website or Eventbrite for more!    
                </p>

                    So where I am going with this? Well often people feel the only way they can give back is by having money to give. You may find this very surprising, but that isn’t the only possibility. Especially as you grow your skills. You will find that you can give back in many ways. Not just by providing a warm body in the room, but providing skills you bring to the world every day. We often may be looking to meet new people, find things to fill our time with or wish we could be doing something more than just at the scale of ourselves. Well I want to encourage you to look for non-profits in your local area. In the tech world there are even open source non-profit projects you can join from around the world. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codetriage.com/">Check this out</a>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best part? You may actually learn a thing or two and have yours eye opened just a bit wider! The TCAT event centered around modifying toys so that those who normally cannot utilize them could. This involved soldering on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)">mono style audio jacks</a> that can easily be swapped with different forms of input. For example something that can be bitten, or mashed like a button or a pad trigger to go next to ones head. We were able to modify these toys so that everyone could have access to the joy they bring as they buzz, light up, and move! Something we often take for granted.    
                </p>
                <img class="blogImgs" src="assets/images/blog/toyhackPost/1.jpeg">
                <p>
                    From what you can see above we were utilizing the soldering iron to modify different toy types. We often don’t realize with just a simple modification we could do so many things. For this one we would take each button on the wireless remote that triggers a triceratops to walk and make noise (awesome toy!) and modify with those mono plug jacks allowing us to use a myriad of triggers!
                </p>
                <img class="blogImgs" src="assets/images/blog/toyhackPost/4.jpeg">
                <p>
                    As you can see we were well supplied with tools and toys to modify. They fed us too. Incredibly generous! The next one we modified was a train that would light up and move!
                </p>
                <img class="blogImgs" src="assets/images/blog/toyhackPost/5.jpeg">
                <p>
                    You can see in the photo we were attaching wires to the switch terminals and then routing the mono plug through the back of the chassis in order to allow for easy adaptability.

                    Check out the completed build! It’s amazing what people can do when they think outside the box and give themselves to a greater good for others. Its often in life we look to ourselves and what we face, but actually participating in making others lives can be quite rewarding. I encourage people to find causes and events related to them that they enjoy. Whether it be for animal welfare, the environment, the elderly, the disabled, poverty, healthcare, or a myriad of other awesome causes. Just get started! You can find events on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.timeout.com/">Timeout</a> to name a few. Please feel free to leave your recent discoveries or what you are passionate about in the comments and get out there…
                </p>
                <p>
                    …you may just find yourself enriching your life and so many others!

                        <a href="">Next Top Makers</a> is a great organization helping the NYC Mayor's office help tell the story of makers in NYC and their journey. Staten Island MakerSpace teamed up with them to throw a hackathon with the general public on a concept of building products for social change. For our project we put together a tweeting trash can with a ring of lights for immediate feedback to inspire trash clean up with positive reinforcement. Typically we use negative reinforcement and it just is not effective enough. If we make people more aware then we can help them be better stewards of their neighborhoods and environment!

                        For the event I partnered with two local high schoolers Crystal Duguid and Antoun Sawires. I wanted to use this event as an opportunity to teach high schoolers the power of arduino and how to code.

                        Our project consisted of a PIR sensor that would detect trash dropped in for triggering a tweet as well as an immediate string of LED lights for positive reinforcement.

                        Come one, come all to the #BitOlympic games! As of July 10th the Bit Olympics has begun for the month of July. What is the Bit Olympics? It is a fantastic gathering of the bit driven minds to remix, make smarter, brighter, louder and more awesomer (a word? No? it should be!) anything that has to do with an Olympic Sport.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We gathered at Staten Island MakerSpace to put our minds to work and design cool and new ways to either recreate or improve the sport. We dived in by grabbing a basic set of bits, seeing how they work and then applying them to the Olympic Games. We even got our whiteboard session on!    
                    </p>
